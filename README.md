# What is this?
This is partially a markup language, but it is mostly just an abstract definition of a document.
The actual content is written in commonmark, but with the strikethrough feature.

# Limitations
Currently, we only support inline links, but commonmark has multiple more link types.
There are also some other things like header metadata that I am ignoring.

# What can it do?
See the `example.html` document. This was generated by release 0.1.1.

# Why did you build this?
I built this so I could make a pretty Resume.
Seriously. I spent the hours implementing a parser, writing the conversion code, and dealing with the absolute pain that HTML is just to make a pretty Resume.
*(The result definately justifies the work though)*
